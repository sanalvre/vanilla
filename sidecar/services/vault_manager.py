# Default template for AGENTS.md — the agent constitution
DEFAULT_AGENTS_MD = """# AGENTS.md — Vanilla Wiki Constitution

This file defines how the AI agent should behave when processing the clean vault
and generating wiki content. The agent re-reads this file on every run.

## Directory Schema

- `concepts/` — Approved concept articles (one per concept)
- `staging/` — Proposed articles awaiting human approval
- `index.md` — Auto-maintained alphabetical index of all concepts
- Knowledge graph stored in SQLite (graph_nodes, graph_edges, graph_source_map tables)

## Rules

1. Never write to the clean vault. It is read-only for agents.
2. Always write proposals to `staging/batch_NNN/` before they can be approved.
3. Every article must have YAML frontmatter with: title, sources, created, last_updated, status, confidence.
4. Sources must reference actual files in the clean vault using relative paths.
5. Use `[[wikilinks]]` to link between concept articles.
6. Group related concepts into a single batch when they come from the same source.
7. When updating an existing article, explain what changed and why in the proposal.

## Traceability Format

```yaml
---
title: Concept Name
sources:
  - clean-vault/raw/source_file.md
created: YYYY-MM-DD
last_updated: YYYY-MM-DD
status: proposed | approved | rejected | stale
confidence: high | medium | low
---
```

## Ontology Reference

See `ontology.md` for the domain-specific ontology that shapes how concepts are categorized.
"""

This file defines the domain ontology for the wiki. It is generated during onboarding
and can be edited at any time. The agent reads this on every run.

## Concept Categories

(Generated during onboarding based on your vault description)

## Relationship Types

- **references** — One concept references another
- **extends** — One concept builds on another
- **contradicts** — Two concepts are in tension
- **exemplifies** — One concept is an example of another
